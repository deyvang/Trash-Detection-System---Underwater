# Under-Water-Trash-Detection

**Overview**:-

This project aims to develop a system for underwater trash detection using computer vision techniques. The system utilizes image processing algorithms to identify and classify different types of waste submerged underwater. By detecting and categorizing underwater trash, we aim to contribute to environmental conservation efforts and promote cleaner oceans.

**Dataset**:-

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of underwater images labeled with different types of trash. The dataset can be obtained from [source link] and should be organized according to the instructions provided in the data/ directory.

**Model Architecture**:-

The model architecture utilized for this project is based on YOLOV8. It is designed to process underwater images and classify them into various trash categories. Detailed information about the model architecture can be found in the model/ directory.

**Training**:-

The training process involves feeding the labeled dataset into the model and optimizing its parameters to minimize the classification error. Training scripts and instructions can be found in the train/ directory.

**Evaluation**:-

To evaluate the performance of the model, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used. Evaluation scripts and guidelines are provided in the evaluate/ directory.

**Usage**:-

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be utilized for underwater trash detection in real-world scenarios. Usage instructions and examples can be found in the usage/ directory.
