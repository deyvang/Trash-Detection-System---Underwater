# Underwater Trash Detection

**Project Overview **:

This project focuses on developing a system to detect underwater trash using computer vision techniques. The system applies image processing algorithms to identify and classify various types of submerged waste. By detecting and categorizing underwater trash, we aim to support environmental conservation and contribute to cleaner oceans.

**Dataset **:

The training and evaluation dataset consists of underwater images labeled with different trash types. The dataset can be downloaded from [source link] and should be organized as per the instructions in the data/ directory.

**Model Architecture **:

This project uses a YOLOV8-based model architecture to process underwater images and classify different trash categories. Detailed information about the model architecture is available in the model/ directory.

**Training **:

Training involves feeding the labeled dataset into the model and optimizing its parameters to reduce classification errors. Training scripts and instructions can be found in the train/ directory.

**Evaluation **:

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Evaluation scripts and guidelines are provided in the evaluate/ directory.

**Usage **:

After training and evaluating the model, it can be used for real-world underwater trash detection. Usage instructions and examples are available in the usage/ directory.

**Contributing **:

We welcome contributions to this project! If you have ideas for improvements, feature requests, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
